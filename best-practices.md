# Effective Learning and Coding Experiments

1. Keep the threshold to starting a coding experiment as low as possible. Make sure the repo, markdown and source file templates, and the tooling make things easy.

2. Keep the exercises small. 80% or more of the exercises should be 1-5 hours. That makes them viable on one or two work nights, or an afternoon on the weekend. It's also better for motivation, allows trying out more topics, and forces focus onto the most important aspect of each experiment. Doing two small exercises seems to be more effective for learning than doing one large one. It's much easier to get stuck in a large exercise with lots of new stuff.

3. Take regular breaks. Timebox the experiments by setting a timer for 1-2 hours and then go for a walk, have dinner, or at the very least make a cup of tea. This avoids zombie-coding, which is a really ineffective use of time.

4. Spend a similar amount of time on (1) reading papers and books versus (2) asking questions with LLMs and (3) doing coding experiments. The three methods are complementary. Reading and asking questions gets new knowledge in, and the coding labs solidify it and identify gaps in that knowledge.

5. Emphasize learning, over progress on the production code-base. Overall, progress in the language/compiler project seems to be characterized by weeks or months of slow progess interspersed by short intense periods of a few days of new feature implementation, once the requisite knowledge is there. Progress seems to come cyclically in these phases:
    - (1-A) read papers and textbooks over the span of weeks / months, to build up new knowledge
    - (1-B) discuss new topics with LLMs and ask hundreds of questions over that same time-period
    - (1-C) do small coding experiments to solidify the new knowledge, but keep it simple, minimal, and focused
    - (1-D) gradually refactor and simplify the production codebase, to prepare it for the next step forward, over that same time period
    - (2) define the exact problem statement and identify the smallest possible variant of the problem to solve
    - (3) prototype the new feature in a 10-20 hour stand-alone prototype and possibly spin it off into its own repository
    - (4) hack the prototype into the production code-base in another 10-20 hour phase
    - (5) clean up the mess you made and possibly do a second attempt, to integrate the new features from the prototype into the production codebase, in a cleaner way

6. Resolve open experiments quickly. Don't leave things lying around 'in progress' unless they will be worked on tomorrow. Close the large 10-20 hour coding labs within 1-3 weeks. If the lab-repo is in a bit of a messy state, with open projects, it tends to tank the motivation for trying out small stuff. Resolving/closing open experiments tends to re-open the door to thinking about and trying new things.

7. Keep reading and learning, even when progress on the main project picks up in pace. Don't wait to get stuck again before picking up the next book or paper. Let it be a routine, to keep the new knowledge flowing in, so that progress is more continuous.
