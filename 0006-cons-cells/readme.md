# Question
<!-- What am I figuring out? -->

1. How can cons cells be implemented?
2. ~~How can map, filter, and reduce be implemented for cons-cells?~~

Date: 2025-11-24

## Resources
<!-- Where can I find relevant information? -->



## Plan
<!-- What do I want to do? -->

1. implement basic cons-cells
2. implement construction and access
3. ~~prototype map, filter, and reduce on those cons-cells~~

## Hypothesis
<!-- What do I think is going to happen? -->



## Experiment
<!-- What did I do? -->
<!-- How do you run the code? -->

- started with a naive implementation for cons cells
- when testing the `first` and `rest` functions on lists I ran into type-checking errors which led me to create tagged types for everything, including values

## Findings
<!-- What did I learn? -->



## Future Work
<!-- Are there follow-up questions? -->
<!-- Can I create a concrete ticket/issue from this? -->

- implement map, filter, reduce for cons-cells
