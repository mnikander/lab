# Question
<!-- What am I figuring out? -->

Can a questions repo, with compact code snippets and notes, speed up learning and implementation?

Date: 2025-10-15

## Resources
<!-- Where can I find relevant information? -->

## Plan and Hypothesis
<!-- What do I want to do? -->

Steps:
- set up a repo for these short questions
- create a simple overview table to keep track of progress in one place (instead of using issues)
- create a template, like a mini lab-report, for these questions and experiments
- create a notes folder, with per-topic markdown files, where I consolidate notes from the topics I'm reading in ultra compact form
- brainstorm questions
- prioritize questions
- do the first couple of questions, preferably small and simple things
- reflect on how it's going and refine the procedure / template as I go along
- try to find ways to make it even more light-weight
- focus on questions where I am really curious or excited, so that motivation is strong

I will make an assessment of how this experiment is going, on or around the 2025-10-31.

## Hypothesis
<!-- What do I think is going to happen? -->

I expect that it will be a pretty big adjustment to make.
It will probably feel a bit daunting at first.
I expect that keeping the questions and coding exercises as small as possible will be beneficial to motivation.
I expect that completing questions will feel good, especially once I combine it with targeted reading.
I suspect that larger questions will only be an option for the weekend.
I suspect that for larger questions, strong interest in the topic will be especially important for completion.

## Experiment
<!-- What did I do? -->
<!-- How do you run the code? -->

Set up the repo and template as described.
Created the this whole project as the very first question.

## Findings
<!-- What did I learn? -->

- doing a coding exercise after work _is_ viable and practical
- it's important to keep an eye on the time though, so I don't lose sleep over it
- exercises during the week are best on the order of 60-90 minutes, so the questions should be really small
- it's fun to try out new things in this quick and easy context, without having to think/worry about a larger codebase
- this could be a really good way to try out a wider variety of things, outside of languages and compilers as well

## Future Work
<!-- Are there follow-up questions? -->
<!-- Can I create a concrete ticket/issue from this? -->
